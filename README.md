
Predictive Sequence Learning
============================

This repository comprise a Java implementation of the Preditive Sequence Learning (PSL) algorithm (e.g. Billing et al. 2011, Billing et al. 2015).

In addition to the algorithm implementation, the repository comprise generic libraries for data sequence analysis, log tools based on [Log4j](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/), and an interface to [Microsoft Robotic Developer Studio 4](http://www.microsoft.com/robotics) based on [Robosoft Lokarria API](http://www.robosoft.com/).
